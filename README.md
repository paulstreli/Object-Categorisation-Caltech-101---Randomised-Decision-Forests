# Object-Categorisation-Caltech-101---Randomised-Decision-Forests
This repository contains the final results for my first Computer Vision Coursework that I completed with my partner Karoly.

The following paper examines different machine learning algorithms for object categorisation, using the Caltech101 dataset. A focus is put on the optimisation of the Random Forest (RF) Classifier and the influence of Bag of Words codebook generation using K-means clustering and Random Forests on classification accuracy. The best performance was achieved with a K-mean codebook of size 200 and a RF-Classifier with 30 trees of depth 8.
